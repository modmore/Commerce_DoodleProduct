# Doodle Product for Commerce

Doodle Product for Commerce is a demonstration module for making a basic custom product. It is ment to get you familiar with making modules with Commerce with the module skeleton such as cloning the composer project, creating namespaces, and extending comProduct. With this module, two custom fields are added to the product form, a select field for shirt sizes and a text field for shirt color. This can easily be adapted to make your own custom product.

For the guide on how to create this module, visit the [Commerce documentation](https://docs.modmore.com/en/Commerce/v1/Developer/Guides/Making_Custom_Products.html).
